				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> Good morning everyone! And welcome to Tall Tale Tuesday<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]:</span> This is the Southern Salesmen and I'm Ben.<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> And I'm Garrett. So, get this. The other day. A couple of weeks ago. Ben and I went over to our grandmother's house.<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]:</span> I can't believe what grandma did.<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> So, we get there and we're all sitting around watching a little TV.<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]:</span>	Grandma's at this point in time she's has had a little bit too much to drink. She's known for her wine drinking, but I think this night she went a little bit too far.<br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> Our little cousin Jimmy decides to pull out a box game called <a style="font-size: 20px"href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S8F7QM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004S8F7QM&linkCode=as2&tag=southsales-20" target="_blank">Cards Against Humanity</b></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=southsales-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004S8F7QM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]:</span> No one had really heard of it. But the only person that had heard of it it was grandma. She had actually heard about them on <a style="font-size: 20px" href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter and she had loved the game ever since. <br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> So Jimmy pulls out the game and we started playing, and Grandma just gets into it, she's dying laughing. <br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]:</span> She kept everyone going. We stayed up until about 3am playing this game simply bc Grandma kept on saying dirty jokes. <br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett]:</span> It was one of the best nights, if not probably the best night, that Ben and I experienced with our Grandma.  <br>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Ben]: It was easily the best and go out, get that product. But before you buy anything on Amazon....
			    <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Garrett & Ben]:</span> SEE. WHAT THE SOUTHERN SALESMEN SAY!</span> <br>
